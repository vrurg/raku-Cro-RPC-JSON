=head1 VERSIONS

=head2 v0.1.6

=item Minor fix to adapt the module to the latest change in C<.^mro(:roles)> semantics

=head2 v0.1.5

=item FIX: availability of C<json-rpc>, C<jrpc-protocol>, C<jrpc-async>, and Cro's C<request> routines.

=head2 v0.1.4

=item Implemented marshalling/unmarshalling of arguments and return values.
=item FIX: a bug preventing methods from returning L<C<Nil>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Nil> or non-L<C<Any>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Any> typeobjects.

=head2 v0.1.2

=item Due to an overlooked naming conflict with Cro attributes and methods named C<request> and C<response> had to be
    renamed. To maintain consistency with exported subs C<jrpc-request> and C<jrpc-response>, the attributes have
    been renamed after them to C<$.jrpc-request> and C<$.jrpc-response>. Same has been done to the plural forms in
    batch request classes. Unfortunately, the change is incompatible with v0.1.1. For this reason it was decided to
    pull out both v0.1.0 and v0.1.1 from CPAN.
=item Tighten bonds with L<Cro's|https://cro.services>
    L<C<request>|https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-request>. Now C<request> term exported by
    L<C<Cro::HTTP::Router>|https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-router> will work where applicable.
=item Implemented JSON-RPC method call authorization.
=item Switching to L<C<zef>|https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez> ecosystem

=head2 v0.1.1
